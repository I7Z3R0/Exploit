CVE-2020-7384

I did this exploit while working on the hack the box challenge called ScriptKiddie. This is the modification of original "msfvenom apk template command injection" I have added reverse shell with nc, bash, python, python3 to get the reverse shell.


The exploit is modified from the original exploit here: https://github.com/justinsteven/advisories/blob/master/2020_metasploit_msfvenom_apk_template_cmdi.md


NOTE : Make sure you have pwntools installed on the computer. If you dont have pwn tools installed replace log.progress with print and then delete from pwn import *

NOTE : I have default directory to save the exploit as /tmp/CVE-2020-7384/exploit.apk, If you want change that path to obsolute one to whereever you required but i would suggest to leave in the default location which i have specified.


RUN: \nmsfvenom -x /tmp/CVE-2020-7384/exploit.py -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 -o /dev/null\n

Have a happy life!
